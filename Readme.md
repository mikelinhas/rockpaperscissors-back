# Rock Paper Scissors Backend

This project serves as a backend to persist the scores from the Rock Paper Scissors game.

## Setup

This project requires internet connection and credentials to access the MongoDb database. Please ask the developer for them.

Please find an example `application.properties` file in the resources folders (test and main).

This game can be run as standalone (without backend) or with its own Rock Paper Scissors backend, running in port 8080.

To run the game use the following commands

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run game in http://localhost:4200
npm start
```

If you wish to use the backend as well to keep track of the scores and persist them, check out the following repo [Rock Paper Scissors Backend](https://github.com/mikelinhas/rockpaperscissors-back)
